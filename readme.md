- Learning Some New Stuffs In C / C++.

### 📄 Makefile 
This Makefile automates compilation and optional execution of the program.
1. Set variables in the Makefile:
   ```makefile
   YEAR              = 2015    # Year of the challenge (valid range: 2015–2024)
   DAY               = 07      # Day of the challenge (valid range: 01–25)
   PART              = 1       # Part of the challenge (valid values: 1 or 2)
   RUN_AFTER_COMPILE = true    # Run the program immediately after compilation (true/false)
   ```
2. Compile (and run if enabled):
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Clean build files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### 🎉 Progress
  Every Program Is Completed In Order And Placed Under Their `Year/Day(s)` Folder Respectively And With This Table You Can See The Complete Overview Of The Progress From 2015 - 2024.
