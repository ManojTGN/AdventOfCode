# ⭐ Advent Of Code
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. \

### 📝 Mission
- ~~Completing In c/c++ (minimal usage of c++)!~~
- ~~Learning Some New Stuffs In C / C++.~~
- Completing In Python (Im extremely bored and changed the objective to complete it. so I choosed <u>Python</u>)
- Not To Look At Any Solution At AnyPoint.

> [!NOTE]
> I originally started solving Advent of Code 2015 in **C/C++** and managed to complete up to **Day 8**.  
> At some point, I lost interest and paused, but I’m picking it up again!  
> From now on, all further solutions will be done **exclusively in Python** (starting from Day 9 onwards).

### 📄 Makefile 
This Makefile automates compilation and optional execution of the program. \
Set your current working directory to advent of code folder and run these commands. \
Set your current working directory to build when running the executables.
1. Set variables in the Makefile:
   ```makefile
   YEAR              = 2015    # Year of the challenge (valid range: 2015–2024)
   DAY               = 07      # Day of the challenge (valid range: 01–25)
   PART              = 1       # Part of the challenge (valid values: 1 or 2)
   RUN_AFTER_COMPILE = true    # Run the program immediately after compilation (true/false)
   ```
2. Compile (and run if enabled):
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Clean build files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### 📄 Other Notes
- From 2015 Day 01 to 2015 Day 07, The Inputs Are Cleaned And HardCoded. :( *Sorry!* 
- 2015 Day 05 Part 2 May throw `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`, Kindly follow the instruction on the 79th line.
